            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <div>
                <p1>With a decade of experience in the medical field as a clinical lab assistant, I have recently made the decision to embark on a new career path as a Full Stack Software Developer. My journey towards this transition began in the fall of 2019 when I pursued studies in architecture and design at the New York School of Interior Design, which sparked my interest in coding. Seeking to deepen my knowledge and skills in this field, I continued my education at Columbia University coding bootcamp, where I delved into the world of software development.
                </p1>

                    <p2>Now, as an entry-level Full Stack Software Developer, I am enthusiastic about the prospect of working with a dynamic tech company. Combining my background in the medical field with my newfound passion for coding. I am eager to contribute my unique blend of skills and experiences to the development of innovative software solutions.
                    </p2>

                    <p3>I approach every project with a commitment to excellence and a strong attention to detail. My time in the medical field has instilled in me a deep sense of responsibility, precision, and the ability to work efficiently in a fast-paced environment. This background has also cultivated exceptional problem-solving skills and an aptitude for collaborating effectively within diverse teams.
                    </p3>

                    <p4>As I embark on this new career path, I am driven by a desire for continuous learning and growth. I embrace challenges with an open mind and a willingness to step out of my comfort zone, constantly seeking opportunities to expand my knowledge and stay up-to-date with the latest industry trends. I believe that my strong work ethic, adaptability, and dedication to producing high-quality results will enable me to thrive as a valuable member of any tech company.
                </p4>

                    <p5>I am excited about the possibilities that lie ahead in the field of software development, and I would be thrilled to contribute my skills and passion to a tech company that values innovation and collaboration. I am eager to embark on this exciting new chapter in my career and look forward to the opportunity to make a meaningful impact.
                    </p5>
